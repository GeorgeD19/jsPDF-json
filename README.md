# jsPDF-json

[![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/GeorgeD19/jsPDF-json/blob/master/license.txt)

jsPDF-json runs JSON schema through [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) to generate PDFs in client-side JavaScript.

## Features
- Maps JSON schema to jsPDF functions.
- Inject data into your schema layouts for dynamic information.

## Install
Since this library is dependent on jsPDF please ensure you have loaded that first. See how to install jsPDF [here](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF/blob/master/README.md#creating-your-first-document)

Using npm:
```bash
npm install https://github.com/GeorgeD19/jsPDF-json.git
```

## API
The jsPDF-json API translates directly to the jsPDF API for example:

```javascript
var schema = `
[
    {
        "text": {
            "text": "Hello, World!",
            "x": 15,
            "y": 15
        }
    }
]`;
var doc = new jsPDF();
doc.JSON(schema);
doc.save('hello-world.pdf');
```

Is the same as:
```javascript
var doc = new jsPDF();
doc.text("Hello, World!", 15, 15);
doc.save('hello-world.pdf');
```

### Inject Data
So you can swap out variables from passed JSON which may be useful with using this library with JSON form libraries:
```javascript
var schema = `[
    {
        "text": {
            "text": {nest.test},
            "x": 15,
            "y": 15
        }
    }
]`;
var data = `
{
    "nest": {
        "test": "Hello, World!"
    }
}
`;
var doc = new jsPDF();
doc.JSON(schema);
doc.save('hello-world.pdf');
```

## How to build
Pull the source by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeorgeD19/jsPDF-json/
```

### Prerequisites
You'll need to have Node.js and Gulp installed. New to Node.js or Gulp? Check out this [writeup](http://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp).
